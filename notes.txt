MTProto, WebWarp: While reporting to 157887279: 
Telegram returned an RPC error: FLOOD_WAIT_X (420) (FLOOD_WAIT_112)

Never had that (obviously), never heard of that either
it means that the account had low 'karma' because of risky factors like 'Nth new account from this IP' and 
such as this. Then you have some chance to recover it by talking with friends from your contacts or 
getting messages from someone first. Telegram thinks 'oh, good, ok', your karma gets higher and you 
can use account normally. 
But if you join the group as your first action on this 'weak' account instead of doing normal-ish things, 
Telegram thinks 'SUSPICIOUS', drops your karma, it gets lower than threshold and boom
